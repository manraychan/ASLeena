# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website that shows of my skills as a software engineer, as well as provides information on my self such as my resume & contact info. I have been able to turn this Basic HTML/CSS tutorial from [CodeCademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) into something so much more by turning the entire site into a React.js app. I hope you like it!
